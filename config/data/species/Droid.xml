          <Name>2-1B Surgical Droid (Genetech/Industrial Automaton)</Name>
          <Description>
            The 2-1B Surgical Droid is a highly intelligent
            and flexible thinker, as one would expect of
            a droid whose decisions involve life and death.  Its
            rather ugly chassis hides a remarkably complex and
            flexible behavioral circuitry matrix, and the droids are
            intelligent and capable in equal measure.

          <Name>3PO Protocol Droid (Cybot Galactica)</Name>
          <Description>
            The 3PO series of protocol droids are some of the most
            human-like automata ever developed - perfect for their assigned tasks
            as ambassadors, political aids,
            translators, and personal attaches.  However, their advanced
            SyntheTech AA-1 verbobrains can sometimes develop neuroses or
            other "quirks".

          <Key>DROIDMOIG</Key>
          <Name>IG Assassin Droid (Holowan Mechanicals)</Name>
          <Description>
            Culminating with the feared and deadly IG-88 model, 
            the IG series is infamous as one of the most
            lethal assassin droids in the galaxy.  IG droids rarely
            meet an opponent they cannot eliminate, and true
            to their humorless nature, they follow the instructions
            for a particular bounty to the letter.

          <Name>LE-V0 Law Enforcement Droid (Rseikharhl Droid Group)</Name>
          <Description>
            The success of LE-VO's is deterring crime in the Rseikharhi sector
            has led to their adoption galaxy-wide as appropriate models for
            police assistance and private security.  Their programming
            requires them to follow Imperial codes to the letter and only
            use force when Absolutely necessary.  Thogh they are hardly ever
            equipped with lethal weponry, they know how to target
            a stun weapon for maximum effect.

          <Key>DROIDMOLOM</Key>
          <Name>LOM Protocol Droid (Industrial Automaton)</Name>
          <Description>
            The LOM series was Industrial Automaton's
            attempt to upset a market dominated by Cybot Galactica.
            IA attempted to make a protocol droid
            very similar to the 3PO units but with an insectoid
            head to appeal to niche markets.  However, bad PR
            from at least one unit's career as a jewel thief
            caused IA to scrap the line.  Some of the remaining
            LOM droids do have a habit of developing interesting
            and unexpected personalities.

          <Name>R-Series Astromech Droid (Industrial Automaton)</Name>
          <Description>
            The wildly successful R-series ranges from the original
            and cumbersom R1 to the famous R2 unit and all the way to the
            soon-to-be-released R6.  Aside from the R1 (which is more than
            two meters tall and works aboard capital ships), all of the R-series
            astromechs are roughly a meter or so tall, and
            designed to ride in sockets aboard snubfights to perform astrogation
            calculations and allow hyperspace jumps.
            A wide variety of tools also make them decent repair droids.
